Use TradeKing because they have low commission fees.

Deposit at least $25,000. Use an ACH transfer (no wire fees) and wait three business days.

Call TradeKing, and see how to flag your account it as a day trading account. This will be necessary.

## Earnings trading

### Background

### Analysis

I recommend only trading companies where analysis shows morning and day win % values
of >= 80% (for *both* morning and day, not just one or the other).

I also recommend prioritizing companies having higher morning and day averages (not
to be confused with win %).

### Trading

Manual

Be **very** careful. If a company does poorly on its earnings release, then you could
lose around 5% or even 10% of your investment in one day.

Study the hell out of a company before trading it.
* Read as much news for the past two quarters as you can.
* Look on StreetInsider.com at the earnings history;
  for example: http://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=nvda

Do not do this unless you know what you are doing and you are confident in your trading abilities.
